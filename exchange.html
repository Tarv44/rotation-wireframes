            <h2>General Thoughts</h2>
            <p>As if there wasn't enough to make us like New Zealand already, I find their music especially attractive. I want to go live there for a little bit and see what the scene is like.</p>

            <h2>"Future Me Hates Me"</h2>
            <h3>The Beths</h3>
            <p>The song title is almost misleading. I mean, when you hear all the lyrics, it makes sense. But the title almost makes you avoid the song so as to not get depressed. But in truth, it's a fucking peppy bump.</p>

            <h2>"Soaked"</h2>
            <h3>Benee</h3>
            <p>The bass on this just instantly makes you groove. Benee goes pretty pop sometimes, but I can't help but be into it regardless of what genre its classified as.</p>
